# Census pipeline rework — notes & initiatives

Status: DESIGNED 2026-09-02; I1 LANDED 2026-09-02 (basis.mjs + census-scc.mjs
master snapshot + overview as query, behavior-identical at main @ 35c6766).
I2 LANDED 2026-09-02: members discovered from the archive's workspace files
(31 found — the frozen lists' 30 + eslint-plugin-lit-ui-router);
city/yard/bricks are queries over the master snapshot writing their own
diagrams/data/*.json plates; bricks fetches @uirouter/core's version-pinned
SOURCE tarball from codeload (the npm tarball ships only lib/) — measured
identical to the old scratch clone (80f/5,272 sloc @ 6.1.2).
I3 LANDED 2026-09-02: shared historyLog() + shared CITY UNIVERSE
(census-query.mjs — sheets 7/7B/13 reconcile by construction);
steam's 90-day window and weather's TODAY derive from the ref's commit
date — the hard-coded dates are gone.
I4 wave 1 LANDED 2026-09-02 (opus fan-out): sheets 2/3/7 import their
plates — numbers by lookup (missing rows THROW), provenance lines rendered
from plate fields, fifth package drawn as city №31 / yard's renamed
"5 published packages" slab / brick schedule row 5 (NOT DRAWN — no stud).
Remaining I4: sheets 7B + 13 (steam/weather plates), cover survey (sheet 1
on census-files.json). Basis for the design: full survey of
`diagrams/generator/` (session altitude-atlas). Budget frame: current plan is
$100/mo with a 5h rolling window, and this work also draws on the Fable weekly
allowance — so the work is cut into initiatives sized to land one at a time,
each its own graft → build → lint → commit → push → republish cycle.

## Why rework

Ten census scripts, five distinct bases, and every number on every sheet is a
hand-pasted constant. The concrete faults:

1. **Basis = whatever's checked out.** Most probes walk the working tree with
   hand-rolled skip lists; steam/weather mix HEAD history with a working-tree
   file universe. Only `census-overview.mjs` is ref-clean (git archive).
2. **Frozen member lists.** The 30-entry MEMBERS/POOL arrays predate
   eslint-plugin-lit-ui-router's graduation; `existsSync` guards make a missing
   dir silently count as zero.
3. **Numbers travel by clipboard.** Probes print JSON; a human pastes constants
   into `sheet*.mjs`. Cross-sheet totals reconcile only by discipline.
4. **Time is hard-coded.** weather `TODAY = 2026-08-17`, steam
   `--since=2026-05-19` — re-running today still ages files against August.
5. **Out-of-band inputs.** @uirouter/core measured from a dead scratch path;
   sheets 9/10/11 bundle probes and the npm dates have no script; 3A/7A cite
   vanished tmp/ generators.

## Target architecture

- **Layer 0 — `basis.mjs`.** `materialize(ref)` → rev-parse sha, `git archive
  <ref> | tar -x` to tmpdir, relative file walk → `{ ref, sha, dir, files,
  commitDate, cleanup }`. Extracted ONCE per run, shared by all probes.
  `--ref` on the CLI, default origin/main. (Pattern: census-overview.mjs;
  scc needs RELATIVE paths + cwd at the tree root.)
- **Layer 1 — one measurement, many views.** One `scc --by-file --format json`
  over the archive is the master per-file census; overview/city/yard/bricks
  become group-by queries over the same rows, so totals reconcile by
  construction. Same move for history: one `git log <ref> -M --name-status`
  feeds steam + weather.
- **Members discovered, not listed.** Derive the member set from the archive's
  own `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + member package.json. Editorial groupings
  (districts, instruments) stay as name-keyed pattern rules with a loud
  "unmatched members" line.
- **Time pinned to the ref.** History probes derive TODAY / windows from the
  measured sha's commit date — reproducible on re-run, honest on any branch.
- **Layer 2 — snapshots are the build input.** Each probe writes
  `diagrams/data/<probe>.json` `{ ref, sha, countedAt, tools, rows }`; sheets
  import the JSON and render basis/provenance lines FROM the snapshot fields.
  Rev letters + rev notes stay manual (editorial). A refresh is still a
  reviewed, committed event — every printed number stays citable to a
  checked-in file.
- **Probe tiers.** T1 pure-tree (overview, city, yard, bricks, 3A) = archive +
  scc, any ref. T2 history (steam, weather) = `git log <ref>` + the same ref's
  archive for the file universe. T3 execution (plate/turbo, mass-3b, nm,
  bundle probes) need an INSTALLED tree: archive → `pnpm install
  --frozen-lockfile` in the tmpdir (+ build for nm); until scripted they run
  on a real checkout of the ref and the snapshot says so.
- **Loose ends.** bricks fetches @uirouter/core itself (npm pack/pacote at the
  cited version); 3A/7A generators reconstructed as T1 queries; npm dates
  become a tiny scripted probe.

## Pipeline self-portrait (the viz of the pipeline itself)

Decision: **flow graph, not lego.** The pipeline's truth is dataflow —
ref → archive → measurements → snapshots → sheets — and a connector/brick
metaphor encodes containment, which is the wrong claim. The atlas already has
the right vocabulary: probes as survey instruments/stations, snapshots as
filed plates, sheets as finished drawings; tier = station type, and the
"one measurement, many views" fan-out is the hero of the picture.

Three escalating lanes (separate initiatives, each independently shippable):

1. **Static atlas sheet** (in-set, numbered, dated like every other plate):
   the survey office. SVG flow in house style; T1/T2/T3 stations, the single
   scc master table as the central instrument, snapshot files as the plate
   cabinet, sheets as the output rack.
2. **Interactive cytoscape graph** in the gallery: data model first — NODES
   (probes, snapshots, sheets, external tools) / EDGES (reads, writes,
   imports) arrays, exactly the pattern used elsewhere. Building sprites as
   node skins via cytoscape node `background-image` (the pinned
   HZD×SC2K×Factorio sprite direction generalizes: sprites are the general
   building representation, so pipeline stations get sprites too).
   Sprite treatment note (2026-09-02): walls are TRANSLUCENT semi-opaque,
   never fully opaque — the girding frame peeks through. Applies to every
   sprite lane (I7 skins, I8 3D, and the weathering-map sprites alike).
3. **3D tilt.** Cheap first step: CSS `perspective` + `rotateX` on the
   rendered graph container (a real tilt, minutes of work, reversible).
   Full step: a three.js isometric scene with billboarded sprites and a
   camera tilt/orbit — its own initiative, only after the cytoscape lane
   proves the data model.

## RDF crossover (silicon-grove, explored 2026-09-02)

Survey of `~/Developer/simshanith/silicon-grove/rdf-playground/` (user's
suggestion). The defensible reuse is narrow:

- **Lift the I7 data model from `rdf-graph-core`.** Its `types.ts`
  `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge` (integer-indexed, namespace-tagged, degree) plus
  `getGraphStats`, `namespace-colors.ts` color map, and the legend generator
  transfer with "namespace" → "node kind" (probe / snapshot / sheet / tool).
  ~200 lines, tested over there; drop the Float32Array physics fields —
  cytoscape owns layout (a probes→snapshots→sheets DAG wants dagre/elk
  layering, not d3-force).
- **Name snapshot provenance fields after PROV-O.** `generatedAtTime`,
  `wasGeneratedBy`, `used`, `wasAssociatedWith` instead of ad-hoc
  `countedAt`/`tools` — near-zero cost now, and it makes a future
  named-graph-per-ref triple view (`<urn:atlas:census/{sha}>`, cross-ref
  diffing via SPARQL `GRAPH ?a … MINUS GRAPH ?b`) mechanical. Oxigraph's
  query path is proven in the playground; the JSON snapshots stay the
  source of truth, RDF a derived view — only worth building if multi-ref
  queries become a real want.
- **Skip:** its Canvas renderer (no sprite/image nodes — cytoscape
  `background-image` is the feature I7 depends on), the Mermaid emitter
  (fine prototype, can't survive into I7), Barnes-Hut/WASM (tens of nodes),
  and the shared 3D ambition (roadmap prose on both sides, zero code).

## Initiatives

Sized in granular cycles (one cycle ≈ one commit+republish sitting). Order is
dependency order; each lands alone.

| # | Initiative | Scope | Cost | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Basis layer + master scc census; port `overview` onto it (behavior-identical) | basis.mjs, census-files snapshot, overview as query | 1 cycle | — |
| I2 | city/yard/bricks as queries + workspace-derived members | kills frozen lists; five-package tree sheets on any ref; bricks fetches core itself | 1–2 cycles | I1 |
| I3 | steam/weather ref-pinned | shared `git log` probe, dates from ref commit date | 1 cycle | I1 |
| I4 | Snapshot-import sheet refactor | sheets read `diagrams/data/*.json`; generated basis lines; big but mechanical → opus subagents | 2–3 cycles | I1–I3 |
| I5 | T3 recipes (turbo, nm, bundle 9/10/11, npm dates) | archive+install harness; costliest, least churn | 2–3 cycles | I1 |
| I6 | Pipeline self-portrait: static sheet | new numbered sheet, house SVG style | 1–2 cycles | design frozen (I1 helps accuracy) |
| I7 | Cytoscape pipeline graph + sprite nodes | NODES/EDGES data model, sprite skins, gallery page | 2 cycles (+sprite authoring) | I6 data model |
| I8 | 3D tilt | CSS-perspective tilt = free rider on I7; three.js scene = stretch | 1 cycle / 2–3 stretch | I7 |

Suggested pacing against the 5h-window + Fable-weekly budget: one initiative
per sitting, mechanical fan-out (I4 especially) delegated to opus subagents,
Fable kept for the design/verify loop. I1+I2 are the highest-value pair (they
unlock counting the fifth package on tree sheets); I6–I8 are the reward lane
and can interleave whenever a sitting has budget left over.
